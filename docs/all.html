        <h1>All Stories</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Typical story of low GPA and having to work hard at the job to get into grad school.</p><small>- 2005A8PS228G</small></li>
<li><p>1st year was a mess with low CG and didn’t know what to do in future. Felt lost but had seniors that helped out in gauging my abilities which is why currently I’m doing well in career and life.</p><small>- 2017A1TS0801H</small></li>
<li><p>Got an E in material science in 3rd sem. My gpa for 3rd sem alone was 4.5 with the best grade I could manage being a C. Repeated material science and still managed only a B in 7th sem. Graduated with a 6.xx gpa. Attended a total of maybe 20 classes in total in the whole 4 years. While I did get a job offer during placements, it had nothing to do with my grades (the company did not even have a CG cut off) or the engineering degree. Just did well in the interviews and thats it. 

After BITS, I spent my entire 20s trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life. Worked in advertising, banking, asset management and fintech. Even did a Master's in finance. Only to realize that finance is not my cup of tea. So now, I am someone with a degree in Mechanical engineering, a master's in corporate finance and now I work in Product in a fashion company in Paris :D

Please know that you guys are all smart to have gotten into BITS in the first place. That smartness can not be taken away from you, you have the brains. All you need is a bit of confidence and you will definitely find something fantastic. Parents or professors might push you to do certain things in certain ways and pressure you, please know that you are all special and unique, you have a place in this world. You just need to find that place, and no grade or professor or subject or college can change that. 5 years from now, noone is even gonna ask you about what you did in college.</p><small>- 2011A4PS182G</small></li>
<li><p>i am B.E Mechanical graduate from BITS goa with 6.03 CGPA,I am an introvert from start and i am from small village due to covid my JEE mains and advance didn't go well and from there my unexpected journey started and mainly as classes were online and as introvert i am not able to make friends and i am not able to adjust to online classes and my cg was 4.35 at end of 3rd semester and the mistake i done was not sharing my problems with and lied about the my CGPA but later i realized that sharing the my problems with others made realize that many people may not be facing the similar problems but everyone have some problems are facing and sharing your problems with other may not solve it but give a relief and release a stress a lot and when it comes to CGPA i think it matters but it is not everything , i have seen people who have struggled to get a placement though there is CGPA is way higher than me but and what i have learned and learning till now the every thing in life treat it as an experience rather than success or failure and give your best. if anyone want to contact you can contact and i am open to hear your experiences.Finally i am currently working as an PM in a gaming startup which is not a success in my life but an ongoing experience.</p><small>- 2020A4PS1564G</small></li>
<li><p>6 point something. Got a branch that I did not want and absolutely abhorred. Decided to take things in my own hands, created SAiDl, cracked GSOC, set up sandbox, managed Kosambi, got into CAMP summer school. Interacted with working professionals.
Decided to do a PhD, realised that academia was to slow for my taste, interned at Amazon after my fourth year and got a full time offer.</p><small>- 2015A3TS</small></li>
<li><p>Failed JEE (and BITSAT) twice, ended up in Pharma, hated every bit of it. Battled crippling mental health issues throughout college and COVID made everything worse, had a D in 4/6 subjects in 1-2 midsems. Multiple semesters between 5.5-6.5 CG, finally ended up with a 7.4 and got placed from campus. It was not my dream placement, but still figuring out and working towards it.It's okay to be slow and it's okay to fail. Pls don't hesitate to reach out :)</p><small>- 2019A5PS1089P</small></li>
<li><p>Barely got into BITS as a dualite Surprised myself with a really high CGPA in first sem which was never reproduced later. Last person to get branch transfer to CS. Things just work out and in the moment when it feels like you are defeated, just take a step back and remember you are probably still in a position that someone else dreams to be in.</p><small>- 2013A7PS660G</small></li>
<li><p>Fought with chronic depression and insomnia in college. There were days where I couldn't find motive to even eat or get out of bed. Have seen loss after loss, even after giving my everything. Restarting my life from scratch after another such blow now.</p><small>- 2013B3TS0502G</small></li>
<li><p>Did so bad in 1-1 and 1-2, that I landed in ACB. Parents were called to the campus to sign an affidavit saying they're going to be more responsible from then on. Struggled so much that the need was felt for a psych eval after 2-1, which declared me clinically depressed. Lost the battle for sobriety in 3-1. Experimented with recreational drugs on campus. Barely avoided getting a sem back when a 29/300 score on a CDC got corrected to 30/300 because, uncharacteristically, I went to collect the compre papers and found an unevaluated correct answer worth 1 mark that changed the NC to E.

Fast forward, graduated with a 5 point something CGPA, courtesy of an A grade in PS2. Got a job, did quite well, went abroad, threw it all away to start my own company that failed in 6 months. In parallel, I took a large loan for a business venture that turned out to be a scam, and I lost all the money. The failures mounted a pressure so high that I couldn't handle it, and started engaging in increasing levels of dangerous behaviour like driving drunk, all alone, all night, just to bungee jump in the morning. Eventually, my parents declared me a danger to society, which led to a second psychiatric evaluation that diagnosed me as mentally ill with a serious disease that's a lifetime handicap, requiring daily medication, with no known cure. I was one step away from becoming a lifelong vegetable, did become morbidly obese, and lost all physical health.

Fast forward, built myself again piece by piece, started to do well, till COVID ripped it all apart. I still picked up the pieces, one day at a time, to try and regain my health first. Lost 10+ kgs a couple of times, permanently quit cigarettes and alcohol, to no addictions today of any kind, including sugar. Worked so much on my emotional and mental health that the third psychiatric evaluation called the previous one an error and declared me healed and medication-free for several years now. Rebuilt my work muscles, starting from working as a freelancer for an approx $0.5 per hour to today working for X.AI (that created Grok and just bought Twitter/ X), and did 71 pushups last week, so believe me when I tell you - IT GETS BETTER. And HELP is always available.

I am one email away.</p><small>- 2010A7PS127G</small></li>

<li><p>Started with a GPA of 8, but ended with 6. Struggled a lot with my startup for 3-4 years after graduation.</p><small>- 2013A4PS217G</small></li>
<li><p>Struggled for quite a bit, found some light at the end of the tunnel. Happy to support and help for anything , literally anything. 
Call me directly, if you will.</p><small>- 2018A5TS1095H</small></li>
<li><p>BITS was an amazing time in my life but not without its fair share of ups and downs. I was lost for the first two years and just getting by while my friends made huge strides and it seemed everyone had figured out what they wanted to do while I was clueless. Even when I tried to score better grades, professors and the system made things difficult and I couldn't achieve my desired outcomes. But at the end of the day, you need to remember that you've already done really well to make it to this college and a few hiccups and failures don't define your life. I decided to take inspiration from my friends and seniors to improve myself and take each challenge as a learning opportunity. Remember, things are never as bad as you think they are when you're in the thick of it. 

Feel free to reach out, whether it's advice or just some pep talk that you need :)</p><small>- 2013A8PS443G</small></li>
<li><p>Hey all! I joined bits goa back in 2020 november, right in the middle of the pandemic. Didn't know what to expect, whom to talk to, how to study. Ended first year with a cgpa of 5.96. I was shattered. I always heard people saying that a good cgpa in 1st year was a job half done. I had failed miserably. It was an uphill battle from there on. 

2nd year was the year of confusion and self doubt. I was in chemical (we all know about the job market). The entire year I kept asking me, "should I switch to IT? They have jobs." Gave it a try. Realised that I wasn't cut out for it. So I decided to give chemical a try. Ended 2nd year with a cgpa 6.9(after ps1). I started making friends. I realised I had a support group to rely on. I missed SIP season as all the cutoffs were 7. That sucked.

3rd year is where I underwent a lot.of character development. I was the VP of celestia. Juggling between acads and por was not easy. The placement sem was coming closer. This was a tough year overall. Managing a club and taking it back to pre Covid times was especially challenging. We did it. I made some of my best friends there. I could share anything with them without getting judged. I changed a lot in 3rd year.

4-1 came. I sat for placements. Half of the sem went away without any companies coming. Some of our best companies did not come for placements.I was questioning all the decisions I had taken that led me to this point. That was a bad sem for everyone. Luckily one company came and I got selected. A big weight was lifted off my shoulders.

Ik this was a very acad heavy story. But believe me when I say it, I've met some of the best people here. Even today when I meet a bitsian, the vibe is different, a bond is already present. Bits has given me so much. It's priceless. I hope you all find your place too. Stay strong and feel free to reach out.

Okay Bbye:)</p><small>- 2020A1PS0836G</small></li>

<li><p>Graduated in 2011, currently a Principal software engineer at Microsoft</p><small>- 2006B4A7671G</small></li>
<li><p>Please talk to however you are comfortable with, but please do, be it friends, seniors, family members, anyone. From my personal experience, jobs, placements, academics, all of these things are part of life. They are not life so take it with a pinch of salt. But please talk.</p><small>- 2013B3A4599G</small></li>
<li><p>I was a pretty average student during my time at BITS and did not know for a long time what career I wanted to pursue. Struggled finding research internships and funding opportunities but was able to chart a course for myself with guidance from seniors and a few genuinely caring faculty members. Went on to do a PhD in Biology and currently working as a postdoc in San Francisco with the intent of becoming a professor one day. Happy to talk to anyone who is struggling.</p><small>- 2012B1A4652G</small></li>
<li><p>Back in BITS, I had to deal with bullying and other social issues for most of my time in college and even a few years after. Also, I was very incompetent with respect to career orientedness and job/internship applications. I didn't even know what an internship was till my 2nd year (yeah, literally).
If anyone had asked me in the second year where I saw myself in the future, I would have panicked. It get's better, though.

With help from others around me, I achieved more than I could have imagined and find myself successful and happy. I will be happy to elaborate and play my part in helping you achieve the same.

We want you to know that you don't have to face anything alone. We seniors are there for you, not only to advise you, but also to help you with solving problems if we can. Our seniors did a lot for us when we were facing problems. We will never hesitate to do the same for you. Just reach out :)</p><small>- 2013A3TS348G</small></li>

<li><p>I got 2/75 in Test 1 in Probability and Stats in Semester 1 even though I had felt I understood it reasonably well. It was a shock. I reached out to others and found most people scored well and some were in the same boat as me. This was disheartening. But I worked hard by studying with some friends who also hadn't scored as well and learning from some friends who had.... ended up getting a B- by the course end.

I remember 2nd Year Sem 1, first class of a math elective where it felt like I didn't have the necessary background to understand what was happening. I still remember calling a senior while walking back from B-Dome, crying with full tears that maybe I won't be able to do it, that everyone else seemed to know everything, that I was terribly behind. She reassured me that I'll be able to catch up since the course will cover some preliminaries so I won't be behind.

I ended up not only catching up after a couple of weeks, but actually getting an A in that course, doing more math courses....(more life events)... all of which lead me to eventually do my PhD in math.

And now I work in Quant Finance, where probability and stats are very important. 

Please reach out to your friends and family and really be there for each other because you don't need to do this alone. Everyone has struggles. It becomes much easier if you talk to others and when we are all there for each other. Bitsians for each other.</p><small>- 2014B4A70689G</small></li>

<li><p>Coming from a humble background with regular hurdles to creating a meaningful career! I hope to be of some use in shaping mental strength.</p><small>- 2015A7PS0034G</small></li>
<li><p>1. 4.9 -> 7.18 CGPA
2. Decent internships & research work
3. Self starter initiatives
4. Product Management - Airtel
5. Fairly good master’s admit - Engineering Management</p><small>- 2018B1AB0615P</small></li>
<li><p>Failed to clear JEE and BITSAT in the first attempt. Didn't had funds to go for masters, and failed to get admission into PhD for two years continuously. Finally going to Georgia Tech for PhD this year. Everything falls into the right place at the right time. I would be happy to talk. I am  just an email away.</p><small>- 2019A4TS0670G</small></li>
<li><p>Engineering never made sense to me, took a while but nagivated a whole different career after that</p><small>- 2014A3PS0314G</small></li>
<li><p>Just another EEE grad with low GPA, dealt with typical (ikyk) phoenix profs, missed compre in first sem, constant low gpa even with much effort and trying no luck. struggled with PS, realised it's all for nothing and it all turned out okay in the end, living peacefully now, have a decent job. never thought about gpa ever since. Just focused on enjoying the good moments of college life.</p><small>- 2018A3PS0430G</small></li>
<li><p>Joined in as a chemistry dualite, switched to physics and choosing EEE, all with the help of my batchmates, seniors and professors. BITS gave me the environment and the tools to interact with folks from different departments, work on collaborative projects and learn to move forward no matter where you came from. Would love to hear your story, learn from it, share my experience and I’m sure we can come up with ideas together. Just reach out, I’m always here.</p><small>- 2013B5A3726G</small></li>
<li><p>I am a final-year student of ME Microelectronics. I am not able to secure any job in the placement cycle, and due to less CG, I got WILP in the Hyderabad campus. 
So basically I am stuck with WILP, where I got no knowledge or experience of VLSI industry I constantly try to find a job. If anyone here who work on any VLSI related company and help to land arrange one interview in digital design or design verification roles it will help me a lot.

<li><p>I joined the E&I program and specifically BITS Goa with the intent to develop my skills in Robotics, Leadership, and Public Speaking. My time at BITS was grueling at times - I felt completely uncertain about my future, felt like an imposter too dumb to make it anywhere, I was frustrated with the "required coursework" not being practical, had multiple heartbreaks, and lost some friendships. 
But the time was even more rewarding - I made a community that I spend days of shared expressions with.  Even now, 10 years later. I am now working for a large Robotics company (self driving trucks), I have made multiple music tracks for my close family and friends' special occasions, explored my dream languages, countries, natural landscapes, roads, and foods, I have met some of my biggest role models in academia and music, and I continue to grow my community in every new location that I move to. This future that I live now was thanks to the community of my family, and the network of friends and acquaintances that I built at BITS. And I want to share that you can materialize the future that you imagine for yourself too. If you find any of this to be relatable.  Please reach out to me at my email or LinkedIn. I am happy to listen and share some time together to help you, the student at BITS, discover your own strengths and future.</p><small>- 2012, A8 (E&I)</small></li>
<li><p>Life at BITS was a mixed bag. Getting into a top college felt great, but it was tough from the start. Back in 2012, I was hopeful for a CS seat because I genuinely enjoyed coding, but my entrance exam ranks had too many trailing zeros—except BITSAT, which got me ENI. Electronics was hard, and I didn’t even like it. I joke that I got C,D,Cs in my CDCs, but it wasn’t easy being the “smart kid” who suddenly struggled. Social life? Also tough—awkward introvert here. And personal life didn’t offer much relief either.  Still, I kept going. I worked hard in my PS2, which became a job, and even repeated a course in my final semester to push my GPA over 7 so recruiters would notice me. That wasn’t the end, though. I spent years in a field I didn’t enjoy before doing a master’s in CS to pivot to AI. It’s taken over a decade since Class 12, but I’m in a good place now—and you can be too. If it’s hard right now, hang in there. Even if your goal is just to be happy—it’ll happen.</p><small>- 2012A8PS300G</small></li>
<li><p>I graduated with a dual degrees in bio  and mech with a not so great cgpa of 7.5. Became a software engineer and I'm still trying to figure it out. You are not alone.</p><small>- 2014B1A40864G</small></li>
<li><p>I am currently pursuing Masters in AI and ML through work integrated learning program. I have just competed my first year in this program. It is a bit challenging to manage both work and masters but I was able to manage. But during my bachelor's I have faced lots of struggle but these struggles made my strong enough to take up any challenge in life. I spent almost 2 years in depression as I used to feel lonely due to lack of friends, self confidence and the competition. I was a good students but when I joined bachelor's I had to face so many failures which I have never experienced in my school days. Those failures made me feel like a complete failure and I went into depression and had to seek medical help. But one thing that kept me going was my persistence. One thing I believe in is that showing persistence during challenging situations can get you out of such situations. Also, there is always someone to help you, you just need to open up. I have reached out to counsellors multiple times. There is solution to every problem in this world. I want students who are facing difficulties not to lose hope as these difficulties will make you stronger. Please reach out for any kind of help.</p><small>- 2024-2026, M.Tech AI and ML, 2024AA05409</small></li>
<li><p>We've all been through tough times in life and just know that you are not alone and there are so many people who care about you. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk!</p><small>- 2018A7PS0280H</small></li>
<li><p>My first year at BITS was completely fucked. I was bad at academics (5-point CGPA), bad at English (everyone in Mime club would converse and joke around in English - I was the guy who was quiet for 1 year - not exaggerating), and I was fat (so no female attention). On top of this, I would think of my parents who would call every day expecting me to be having the best time of my life - all I would say is "yes, it's great". 
All I had was perseverance. I fixed one thing at a time. In my 1-2, I found my comfort zone  to speak broken English with eventually giving me the confidence to build strong connections across everyone in the club by the 2nd year. In 2-1, after my parents forced me to quite mime due to CGPA, I decided to attend all classes - 2-1 GPA crossed 7 - hence, made the case to my parents to rejoin mime because friends = sanity. Finally, bombed all the limited interviews I was eligible for and had to join a mass hirer. Applied externally, got rejected everywhere. Finally landed my dream job - now 10 years have passed and I'm still here. And guess what, no one asks about my CGPA.
Guys - life is not linear - not for you, not for the guy next to you. Everyone will go through deep trenches in life. All you need to do is persevere, somehow. If things feel overwhelming, talk to people and don't try to figure everything out at once. Sometimes all you need to give life is time and it figures itself out. End mein sabka sahi ho jaata hai - just have faith in the universe and yourself.</p><small>- 2011A1PS019G</small></li>
<li><p>BITS has always been a home and a safe space to me. Friends, batchmates and seniors are always there to help.</p><small>- 2013-18, CS+Chemistry, 2013B2A70754G</small></li>
<li><p>Learnings from College Life:
1. Priortise sleep over grades. Late night study only creates unnecessary anxiety and stress. 2. Please dont compete with your friends. It will make college life miserable. 
2. Try to be regular to classes, 100% attendance helped me in passing, if not acing the exams. 
3. If you face any challenges (about grades, peers or personal issues), please do not hesitate to speak to your Seniors, Alumni, Parents or Professors (In Pilani, for instance Management and Humanities department profs are really good)-whosoever you find the most approachable. You shall eventually figure the way out.
4. Prefer IPC(Pilani) over library and room for exam preparation. the constant distraction in the Library and room will not let you concentrate. 2 hours of IPC Study = 15 hours of Library/30 hours of Room Study! I would say, IPC is the most underrated space in Pilani. I missed this place for 3 online semesters. 
5. Dream big and dont care about grades. Attempt the exam with your best efforts and leave the rest. You shall be remembered as BITSian, not as a 5 pointer.
6. Explore as many as courses as you wish to. Many dull courses in a particular semester can be counterbalanced with a single interesting course. Entrepreneurship courses shall give you a real thrill, trust me! You will forget all monotony of life in the classroom.
7. Keep Minor degree as a backup option. Investment of 20k (in our times) can give you an edge in off-campus (or on-campus) placements.
8. Maintain good relationship with your professors (from your own and other Departments), so that you can contact them in the future whenever you need them.
9. Being an introvert is fine. You shall eventually be friends with someone.
10. A low Grade cannot spoil your future prospects. Extra-curriculars and PS will eventually make up for the damage done.</p><small>- 2019A5PS1090P</small></li>
<li><p>BITS GOA made me who i am today. And much more than college, it was the wonderful set of people i was surrounded with. 

From being an introverted and timid person to becoming a headstrong and confident individual. From barely being able to get a C in all courses to getting a 7.5 CG while graduating. 

It always works out, you just have to believe and be kind to yourself. Let’s talk!</p><small>- 2013A4PS241G</small></li>
<li><p>Each person's college experience is unique, and challenges are kinda bound to arise. There's no doubt that times can be rough. Although what always helps is reaching out and getting another perspective. I was lucky to get support and guidance to help me get through my struggles. 
So if you ever feel like talking, don't hesitate to reach out.</p><small>- 2013A7PS006G</small></li>
<li><p>Started in COVID with a very low CG, coming from not so big city, didn't knew a lot of people, very introverted so speaking with new people was a daunting task, been through phases of self doubt. Just trust the process.
Feel free to reach out, anytime, always there!!</p><small>- 2020A4PS2104G</small></li>
<li><p>Well, to start off I didn't clear JEE or BITSAT in my first attempt. And after taking a drop year I could manage to get in to Chemical. In my first sem, I lost track of number of 0s I got in midsem and compres. I got 4.64, barely safe from ACB. In the 2nd semester I got 5.5. 

Things aren't as good or as bad as it seems. Just hang-in there and keep doing what you like with a pathway to be where you want to be.

So many paths were closed because of my CGPA, like Finance Minor, Preferred PS stations etc. But that's not the end of the world. Just don't take the rules as very rigid and try doing things which are unconventional. You'll be around your early 20s and try to take as much risk as possible if your family situation allows you.

Without any formal training in CS, I was a founding engineer for US based startup which happened because I helped in making an MVP through which we raised $2M. 

If someone had me told that I'll be pursuing a masters degree down the line in my 1st year, I'd have asked are you blabbering. Years later, now I'm going to pursue one at UC Berkeley from this Fall. Just grab all the opportunities life gives you for redemption. 

That being said, please don't fall into the illusion of survivorship bias. I met some unbelievably good people who helped me and got lucky at places. But to get lucky you need to increase your surface area.

The trick is surviving long enough to get lucky :)</p><small>- 2018A1PS0015G</small></li>
<li><p>MSc Physics + BE CS. Completely bombed numerous CS courses because the dual was incredibly tough to balance and the skill sets and cultures across department communities were at ends. Took a gap year to write the Physics GRE, and graduating with a Physics PhD soon.</p><small>- 2013B5A70589G</small></li>
<li><p>I had a GPA of 9.5+ throughout all semesters. I chose to pursue a thesis and skipped the 4-1 placement season. When I returned in 4-2, I had no PPO from my SIP.

The last semester of 4-2 was a disaster — I was rejected by a total of 16 companies during campus placements. It was a really rough time, filled with uncertainty and personal challenges. One of the hardest parts was not being able to attend my sister’s wedding due to some unavoidable issues.

What truly carried me through were my friends. There were always kind and beautiful souls around who were willing to talk and support me. I also realized that opening up — whether it's to a close friend, an elder sibling, or anyone you trust — really helps. It’s okay to talk, and you don't have to go through everything alone.

Eventually, things worked out. I got an offer from a good company, and while the journey wasn’t smooth, it taught me a lot.

Feel free to reach out — whether it’s for advice or just a little pep talk. I’m always here :)</p><small>- 2020A7PS0085G</small></li>
<li><p>Just a regular BITSIAN. I was average at best at studying. Still remember the time I had a lesser Course Total in PnS than my PCT (Got negative in compre) and the time I had 1 mark in M3 compre because I got the wrong notebook for an open book exam. Currently working at JPMC (without a Fin Minor). Open to any and all discussions. If I could bounce back, literally anyone can.</p><small>- 2020A8PS1301G</small></li>
<li><p>At the end of 2nd Year I was diagnosed with an incurable disabling disease, It shattered my dreams and the issues with the illness made working in Mechanical Engineering or Chemistry industry (my chosen degrees) near impossible.
I felt lost and for next 2 years, I barely went to classes and was depressed to the point that I started antidepressants, my cgpa wasn't kind during this and I think I got near 4.5 for 2-3 sems. 
My PS and internships changed things, because I realised that cgpa didn't really matter for any job, that every job required you to learn and do things from scratch and those tasks barely had a relationship with what we learnt. All they or any job requires is the ability to learn, a skill that you already proved you had by getting into BITS.
So after a lot of thinking, searching and asking practically every person I could find, I started learning software development as an alternative career path during my internship and now currently work as a lead software developer for a logistics startup in Bangalore. 
Life isn't always easy, and sometimes we feel like there is no other path and are trapped in our situation and consequences. Reach out, cuz there might be a way you didn't see and even if there isn't, there will be someone who could walk beside you for it.</p><small>- 2013B2A4705G</small></li>
<li><p>Had my fair share of good and bad moments at campus, more than happy to lend an ear to anyone who has something on their mind</p><small>- 2018A1PS0379G</small></li>
<li><p>I struggled with my sense of self and self-worth while at BITS and more so during my Master's. Achieving more did not give me the peace I wanted and deserved- therapy did. I couldn't have made it this far without mental health support in this country and I know we are not yet evolved in our thinking and perspective about success in India. I strongly believe we need to redefine success as a nation. Pressure from our parents and the society may not change but we are adults capable of setting boundaries that benefit our lives. I'd be happy to support anyone who is struggling with unhelpful thoughts change their perspective a little bit.</p><small>- 2010A5C7899P</small></li>
<li><p>BITS has given me a lot and I truly believe all of us can achieve whatever we set our minds to, we are the smartest and most driven people out there! Don't worry too much about acads - sure CGPA matters but what matters the most is what you make out of those 4 years - talk to lots of people, join lots of clubs, try different things to see what sticks. You are in safe hands - BITS has a really (and I mean really) strong brand name and an absolutely awesome alumni support. Once you graduate, there will be people everywhere ready to help you in whatever way you require. Just keep trying things out to figure out what you wanna do in life. I've seen people with 5 CGs from BITS get into CMU and people with 7 CGs get into top 10 (fully funded) grad schools. Yes, CG matters but what matters more is what you wanna do and your dedication and perseverance towards it - fuck the past, start working towards what you wanna do now. No one cares about your past, the world only cares about you wanna do (or plan to do) in the future. You got this, we are all here for you, I am personally rooting for you ❤️</p><small>- 2017A7TS0099G</small></li>
<li><p>I have equally run through highs and lows of academics at BITSG, but what has stood the test of time is the personality I've grown (and so does EACH of us) as a BITSian. I am now working in a respectable job in the Netherlands as a process engineer and learnt to tread the various horizons in a diversely multicultural place like Europe!

Do reach out to me to talk about life at BITS, your doubts about studying abroad or general guidance of making a difference with your personality :)</p><small>- 2013A1PS760G</small></li>
<li><p>Life is non-linear and BITS is probably the first time many of us experience this. 
If my experiences can help in future BITSians navigate this, more than happy to help.</p><small>- 2016B1A30617G</small></li>
<li><p>Came in with Physics, and wanted a CS dual, because everyone wanted it. My first sem CG was 7.5 and I was really worried about my future at the time. Then came second sem, gave up hope for CS dual, studied because I wanted to learn and ended up with SG 9.1. I got the CS dual but realized in 3rd year that I liked Physics and wanted to make a career in it. In the end, I dropped my CS dual in 3rd year despite the backlash from friends, family and professors. 

After building up my “profile” for Physics PhD, I applied 65 times and was rejected 65 times. It was difficult to handle rejections at the time, I believed that I was special and would easily get in. Used to feel helpless at the time. Next, I applied for industry positions, did not have much luck there either. 

Subsequently decided to write CAT—did poorly on it but did well in NMAT. I took the offer from NMIMS Mumbai and am going to start my second year next month. I’ve realized that everyone’s journey is different, you are no better or worse off than others.

 Do not associate your worth with your grades, performance, CTC etc. You are all special, and full of potential. If it doesn’t work out today, this month or this year—its alright, that doesn’t mean you’ve failed. You will go on to do much better things that you’ve never imagined. 

For the boys out there, it is okay to feel clueless, helpless and cry. What helped me during difficult times in Pilani was taking long walks and talking to myself believing that things would turn around soon. If you need someone to talk to (we all do!) please reach out.</p><small>- 2016B5TS0588P</small></li>
<li><p>There were a lot of up and downs in college life but whenever I look back, I feel those were the best 4 years of my life. No matter what problems you are facing right now someone has faced it before and will be ready to help you cope with your situation. Talk to your seniors or your peers to get through the tough times.</p><small>- 2013A3PS168G</small></li>
<li><p>Keeping myself anonymous for reasons which will become obvious later. Do give my story a read of you get time :)

Introverted and underconfident kid since my school days. Quite bright academically but more of a history nerd and literature enthusiast. Got into IIT prep because that's what was cool. Lacked discipline and got below expected scores in IIT and even BITSAT. 

Joined BITS with as Math student, couldn't figure out what to do and all. But became a extremely social and popular person. Didn't figure out academics well. Got hospitalized before 1-1 compres. Got below expected grades. Felt the need to get CS, for no reason other than everyone is targeting it, studied like hell. Did great in 1-2 but missed CS by 0.0x. Second year went great, explore math and CG was good. Tried hands in coding, development, machine learning, but wait I don't like it? Why is everyone doing it? Seemed pretty boring to me.

3rd year, epic-ly flunked academics. Loved the content but never got good grades. Lots of C-s few Ds and one E as well. CG dropped significantly. Held 2 PORs and did significant work there. Started smoking lots of weed and experimented with other drugs as well. 

Somehow managed to survive 4-1. Got hospitalized again in 4-2 and this time had to take a sem drop which became a year drop because courses were not offered. College was least supportive. Parents and family were quite supportive. 

Meanwhile girlfriend cheated on me, and then spread the rumour I assaulted her. Leaked some explicit photos of me. Friends left. Social media trial. Became suicidal and depressed. Started clinical counselling, medications and the usual stuff. But slowly realized gaps in it. Started questioning and deep diving into psychology and also explored spirituality and religions. Healed myself over the year drop, and practice schools and some initial years of jobs. Made some great friends who helped me a lot along the way. Not as many friends as before, not even close, but would gladly drop everything for these few guys at this point. Still healing myself daily by enjoying life :)

Did various internships which I didn't like, joined a startup which failed, joined a services based company which was boring, joined a huge bank with interesting work but slow pace. And much more. Somehow figured working in the domain of product management and analytics, but that's not my entire thing. Realized that work is just a part and don't let it define myself completely. 

Now I work in a mid sized company, great products and wlb. Took a pay cut for better life. Doing work with a musical artist. Doing advisory role for a few startups. Writing a blog about psychology. Writing a book and potential game script. Go on few weeks trips almost regularly. Connected with family and friends. Transformed from fat asf to fit and also doing MMA now.

I'm quite happy now. Unfortunately the grind never stops if you're just following trends and in the rat race. It changes from acads, CG, grades to increment, promotions, base salary to having 10k followers to travelling XYZ countries, reading 100 books, going to gym 6 days a week to having kids and then living your missed aims in life via your kid.

So take a break. Just look at yourself. Write your thoughts. What makes you happy? What's something which interests you? Explore yourself. Do what works for you. Don't stop in hell, keep going.</p><small>- 201xB4AA</small></li>
<li><p>We learned the concept of take it li8 at BITS and this has stuck throughout. Just take it li8 when nothing else makes sense.</p><small>- 2010A3PS120G</small></li>
<li><p>Your Grades don't determine your success. A 10 pointer is not going to outperform a 6 pointer. You will remembered as a BITSian and not by your grade.</p><small>- 2019A5PS1090P</small></li>
<li><p>Grades while being slightly important are not so important that they shape you. Grades are just an easy way out, but the real quality is how determined you are. I wasn't ever a very high scoring student but still managed to get a PS at JPMC. No one at JPMC has ever asked me about my grades in any subject. They don't even care if I am from BITS or not, they care about the attitude, willingness to work and learn. Talking to people is always a very good choice as it can help you lighten up and also give a more diverse perspective. If anyone's ever feeling low or confused, always try to speak to someone.</p><small>- 2013A1PS523G</small></li>
<li><p>I didn’t do great in JEE, and—as you can guess from my ID, I only got into BITS in the 5th iteration. Imposter syndrome hit right away. Instead of leaning on my strengths, I kept thinking I didn’t belong. Every club I tried to join rejected me. My GPA tanked in the first two years. I liked electronics, but PS‑1 sent me to a cement factory. I hated most of the “opportunities” BITS handed me and just wanted to graduate early. The ARC wouldn’t give me the courses I actually cared about, only whatever my department offered. I did manage to finish early, but didn't appear for placements, and had no job or no real plan. I’d never made many friends at BITS, and I drifted apart from the few I did have. Depression set in hard; every day felt dreadful. I took a bland job just to get by, all the while looking for something that could make a real, positive impact.

Then COVID hit. Somewhere in that chaos I finally figured out what I wanted to do with my life. I’m not as depressed now, and I’m working toward a PhD in Information Science at Rutgers.</p><small>- 2014A8TS0855G</small></li>
<li><p>While I was at BITS, I put so much pressure on myself to be perfect — in academics, co-curriculars, and social life — all at once. Surrounded by people who seemed so clear and successful, I often felt anxious and overlooked my own progress. No achievement ever felt like it was enough. It’s taken years of reflection and effort to shift this mindset. Through different jobs, and countless conversations with friends, mentors, coaches, and therapists, I’ve learned that my worth isn’t tied to my professional success or social status. True happiness, I’ve realized, comes from living each day with gratitude and warmth. And when you do that, everything else eventually falls into place. Always here to chat if you're feeling down. There is a way forward no matter how bad things feel in the moment.</p><small>- 2012B2A3601G</small></li>
<li><p>I am the first female in my family to receive a college education, let aside one in STEM. In 2017, it was the first time that BITS had dropped its cutoff to as low as 202, and guess what, it was infact me who secured the very last seat in Goa campus with that score (not very proud of it but I'm glad for this opportunity to have miraculously appeared in my life- BITS PILANI, IT'S MAGIC!). It didn't end there, my first year CG was 4.9, I wasn't even sure if I would get Chemical as my B.E. dual. The worst part of it all? This happened despite attending ALL the lectures and tuts, religiously making notes while sitting in the first bench (which would be later shared amongst the ghots), going through previous year papers before the exam, spending hours in the library, and what not. Sigh! There were folks who intentionally (or not) ridiculed me, said how I was living up to my 202 score. But then, there were peers and professors who motivated me and believed in me throughout. "Arya, you don't know it yet but I know you'll go far in life", "You know Arya, as a student you have the privilege to make mistakes. Don't be scared to take your chances", "It's not a bad grade, but a rather a bad day"-the list is endless and I can go on and on about it.

Well, the above text was an overview of a part of my BITSian life. And if you are still reading this long paragraph, I am glad to have been able to hold you attention for this long haha! Thank you. Therefore, in return, how about I listen to your stories? Sounds like a fair trade-off right? :P</p><small>- 2017B1A10831G</small></li>

<li><p>I got a D in Signals and Systems. Years later, I worked on signal recovery for a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. I struggled through EEE with Physics, barely managing 8 courses a semester as a dualite. I barely survived MuP, never took CompArch, and am now working with various processors, learning, developing. Chilling out at a startup in Sweden, living a stressfree life. 
In Sweden, you have infinite chances to take re-exams. I had to take a Algorithms exam twice to make it with a higher grade that PhD needed. Failing an exam or getting a low grade once is not a failure of your capabilities. 
But I also had incredible support — seniors who reminded me I was good enough, professors who encouraged me to pursue topics I was passionate about. Managed to finish a PhD in a topic I was passionate about and then switched fields. 

It’s okay to not have it all figured out. It’s okay to fall. There is always a way forward.  Please be kind to yourself. You’re not alone in this journey.</p><small>- 2013B5A3466G</small></li>
<li><p>I got 4.5 GPA in Semester 2 itself along with the worst attendance possible. I literally skipped announced quizzes just because it was a game night the night before. No I did not graduate as a 9+ CGPA or anything close. Later in life, again after failing twice, I cleared UPSC CSE and got into the IAS. So, please stop taking too much load. Things will fall into places.</p><small>- 2013A1PS544G</small></li>
<li><p>Almost failed Engineering Design, was found guilty of not adhereing to academic policies in Professional ethics lol. Failed all placements interviews, PS didnt offer PPO and the list goes on. Yet here am I living my best life</p><small>- 2013A3PS307G</small></li>
<li><p>First gen STEM, got into the university with the mindset "I got into BITS and now my life is set" and ignored my acads to the point that I scored straight Es in my 2-2 CDCs. Having someone to talk to can really make a difference, I had my fair share of people who lent me their ears, and now I can lend you mine.</p><small>- 2011A1TS473G</small></li>
<li><p>Just almost managed to get into BITS, started first semester in hopes of getting a CS dual, ended with first year CG 6.76, got multiple Es and Ds all across Electronics, overslept and missed a T1 for a CDC. It turned out to be okay, please talk to people around you or ping any senior.</p><small>- 2013B4A8662G</small></li>
<li><p>Remember that college is a place to experiment and try things out. It’s okay to fail miserably in terms of your grades, in terms of your relationships and everything else because all of this will help you discover yourself. Some of the smartest people I know had a bad CGPA, some of the best professionals I know never got placed on campus. I failed too, a lot – I had my girlfriend move on to someone else, I never got a job on campus and had no clue what I was going to do after I graduated. It’s okay for things to go wrong, but the one thing that remains true is please reach out – could be your friend, your senior, your sibling, whoever – reach out and talk when you are down. Where you are now and how you are feeling now does not determine where you will be tomorrow!</p><small>- 2011B2A4548G</small></li>
<li><p>Chemistry was my favorite subject in school. At BITS, I don’t think I scored above a C in a single chemistry course. I had terrible attendance, missed every surprise quiz, and honestly had no idea how to handle the freedom that came with being on my own for the first time. I wasn’t disciplined, and I often felt like I was falling behind while everyone else had it figured out. I spent two years chasing research. Just when I was about to go in for a thesis, I panicked — and switched to a PS at the last moment. It wasn’t strategy or brilliance — it was uncertainty, a lot of overthinking, and a bit of blind luck. Somehow, things worked out. What I’ve learned is: life rarely moves in a straight line. There will be setbacks. There will be moments where it feels like there’s no way out. But something will appear — a detour, a person, an opportunity you didn’t see coming. If you're struggling, please know this — you're at BITS because you're smart. But more importantly, you're not alone. Talk to your friends. Talk to your professors. Let someone in. The smartest thing you can do sometimes is ask for help. Be kind to yourself. If something doesn’t work out today, it doesn’t mean it never will. I promise, even in the most unexpected ways — things get better.</p><small>- 2011B2A1599G</small></li>
<li><p>I started my very first semester with poor grades but somehow things fall into place as you make your way. There's always a path for you and it doesn't have to be what everyone else is doing.</p><small>- 2013A7TS053G</small></li>
<li><p>I took CS only to later find out that I simply can't understand coding , got few friends - and only because of them i barely graduated , i am yet to figure out lots of things and sometimes things gets messy so just wanted to let you know that you are not alone , and their are still kind people who do help others</p><small>- 2020A7PS1688G</small></li>
<li><p>I was someone who didn't take studies seriously in college and ended up in a very bad spot after college ended. Didn't bother to attend classes, got Ds and C- s. My best grade was in electives which was B-. Sat through placements when i had 4.97 cgpa. Graduated with 5.76 ( thanks to PS). Didn't get placed in college. Prepared for GATE exam. Flopped there too. Didn't even qualify. After 1 year of graduating I started learning coding and then slowly life moved into a track which I started feeling happy about! If you are facing any difficulty, it's not because you useless, it just might take some time to figure things out or understand what you really like doing. And it's ok to take that time.

I screwed my acads big time, barely edged 7, received an NC in ADVD. I thought my parents & friends would think lowly of me. I thought I was cooked. But its too late to do the right thing. I grinded through all the courses again & cracked GATE with a pretty good tank. I'm now pursuing M.Tech in Integrated Circuits & Systems from IIT Bombay, which is one of the best programmes for VLSI Design in India. I'm absolutely enjoying this.

<li><p>I graduated with a CG of 6.1 in Computer Science. I didn't like most of the subjects at all and never knew my calling in life. Worked for 2 years in web development, even that didn't appeal to me. After taking a break for 6 months and doing some online courses from Udemy, I broke into data analytics. I am currently working to transition into data/ML engineering. No matter what life throws at you, take it as a challenge and keep smiling!

Having contemplated the worst, I genuinely believe time makes everything better.

<li><p>Classic over-achieving student in school who suddenly entered BITS and found out he was "av minus" everywhere, in everything, and all the damn time. Even getting into BITS was a struggle, just barely making it in the 5th iteration in our year. Took on Maths + EEE, and struggled really hard in EEE. Probably scored the lowest scores on our placement preparation mock tests. Failed so spectacularly that I might have set a record low (negative 15 marks out of 100 something). Trusting faculty members paid dividends. Seniors helped out. Inspired me to do something with my 2 theses, and that was all I needed. Confide in friends, seniors and family.

<li><p>When I was at BITS, it felt like lower CG was probably the worst thing possible. It’s 3 years later and I haven’t thought about CG or what grades I got at BITS all these years.
