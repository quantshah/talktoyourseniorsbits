My gpa for 3rd sem alone was 4.5 with the best grade I could manage being a C. Repeated material science and still managed only a B in 7th sem. Graduated with a 6.xx gpa. Attended a total of maybe 20 classes in total in the whole 4 years. While I did get a job offer during placements, it had nothing to do with my grades (the company did not even have a CG cut off) or the engineering degree. Just did well in the interviews and thats it. \n\nAfter BITS, I spent my entire 20s trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life. Worked in advertising, banking, asset management and fintech. Even did a Master's in finance. Only to realize that finance is not my cup of tea. So now, I am someone with a degree in Mechanical engineering, a master's in corporate finance and now I work in Product in a fashion company in Paris :D\n\nPlease know that you guys are all smart to have gotten into BITS in the first place. That smartness can not be taken away from you, you have the brains. All you need is a bit of confidence and you will definitely find something fantastic. Parents or professors might push you to do certain things in certain ways and pressure you, please know that you are all special and unique, you have a place in this world. You just need to find that place, and no grade or professor or subject or college can change that. 5 years from now, noone is even gonna ask you about what you did in college.", "bits_id": "2011A4PS182G"}, {"story": "i am B.E Mechanical graduate from BITS goa with 6.03 CGPA,I am an introvert from start and i am from small village due to covid my JEE mains and advance didn't go well and from there my unexpected journey started and mainly as classes were online and as introvert i am not able to make friends and i am not able to adjust to online classes and my cg was 4.35 at end of 3rd semester and the mistake i done was not sharing my problems with and lied about the my CGPA but later i realized that sharing the my problems with others made realize that many people may not be facing the similar problems but everyone have some problems are facing and sharing your problems with other may not solve it but give a relief and release a stress a lot and when it comes to CGPA i think it matters but it is not everything , i have seen people who have struggled to get a placement though there is CGPA is way higher than me but and what i have learned and learning till now the every thing in life treat it as an experience rather than success or failure and give your best. if anyone want to contact you can contact and i am open to hear your experiences.Finally i am currently working as an PM in a gaming startup which is not a success in my life but an ongoing experience.", "bits_id": "2020A4PS1564G"}, {"story": "6 point something.

Parents were called to the campus to sign an affidavit saying they're going to be more responsible from then on. Struggled so much that the need was felt for a psych eval after 2-1, which declared me clinically depressed. Lost the battle for sobriety in 3-1. Experimented with recreational drugs on campus. Barely avoided getting a sem back when a 29/300 score on a CDC got corrected to 30/300 because, uncharacteristically, I went to collect the compre papers and found an unevaluated correct answer worth 1 mark that changed the NC to E.\n\nFast forward, graduated with a 5 point something CGPA, courtesy of an A grade in PS2. Got a job, did quite well, went abroad, threw it all away to start my own company that failed in 6 months. In parallel, I took a large loan for a business venture that turned out to be a scam, and I lost all the money. The failures mounted a pressure so high that I couldn't handle it, and started engaging in increasing levels of dangerous behaviour like driving drunk, all alone, all night, just to bungee jump in the morning. Eventually, my parents declared me a danger to society, which led to a second psychiatric evaluation that diagnosed me as mentally ill with a serious disease that's a lifetime handicap, requiring daily medication, with no known cure. I was one step away from becoming a lifelong vegetable, did become morbidly obese, and lost all physical health.\n\nFast forward, built myself again piece by piece, started to do well, till COVID ripped it all apart. I still picked up the pieces, one day at a time, to try and regain my health first. Lost 10+ kgs a couple of times, permanently quit cigarettes and alcohol, to no addictions today of any kind, including sugar. Worked so much on my emotional and mental health that the third psychiatric evaluation called the previous one an error and declared me healed and medication-free for several years now. Rebuilt my work muscles, starting from working as a freelancer for an approx $0.5 per hour to today working for X.AI (that created Grok and just bought Twitter/ X), and did 71 pushups last week, so believe me when I tell you - IT GETS BETTER.

I was lost for the first two years and just getting by while my friends made huge strides and it seemed everyone had figured out what they wanted to do while I was clueless.

But at the end of the day, you need to remember that you've already done really well to make it to this college and a few hiccups and failures don't define your life.

I joined bits goa back in 2020 november, right in the middle of the pandemic. Didn't know what to expect, whom to talk to, how to study. Ended first year with a cgpa of 5.96. I was shattered. I always heard people saying that a good cgpa in 1st year was a job half done. I had failed miserably. It was an uphill battle from there on. \n\n2nd year was the year of confusion and self doubt. I was in chemical (we all know about the job market). The entire year I kept asking me, \"should I switch to IT? They have jobs.\" Gave it a try. Realised that I wasn't cut out for it. So I decided to give chemical a try. Ended 2nd year with a cgpa 6.9(after ps1). I started making friends. I realised I had a support group to rely on. I missed SIP season as all the cutoffs were 7. That sucked.\n\n3rd year is where I underwent a lot.of character development. I was the VP of celestia. Juggling between acads and por was not easy. The placement sem was coming closer. This was a tough year overall. Managing a club and taking it back to pre Covid times was especially challenging. We did it. I made some of my best friends there. I could share anything with them without getting judged. I changed a lot in 3rd year.\n\n4-1 came. I sat for placements. Half of the sem went away without any companies coming. Some of our best companies did not come for placements.I was questioning all the decisions I had taken that led me to this point. That was a bad sem for everyone. Luckily one company came and I got selected. A big weight was lifted off my shoulders.\n\nIk this was a very acad heavy story. But believe me when I say it, I've met some of the best people here. Even today when I meet a bitsian, the vibe is different, a bond is already present. Bits has given me so much. It's priceless. I hope you all find your place too.

Also, I was very incompetent with respect to career orientedness and job/internship applications.

It get's better, though.\n\nWith help from others around me, I achieved more than I could have imagined and find myself successful and happy.

But I worked hard by studying with some friends who also hadn't scored as well and learning from some friends who had.... ended up getting a B- by the course end.\n\nI remember 2nd Year Sem 1, first class of a math elective where it felt like I didn't have the necessary background to understand what was happening. I still remember calling a senior while walking back from B-Dome, crying with full tears that maybe I won't be able to do it, that everyone else seemed to know everything, that I was terribly behind. She reassured me that I'll be able to catch up since the course will cover some preliminaries so I won't be behind.\n\nI ended up not only catching up after a couple of weeks, but actually getting an A in that course, doing more math courses....(more life events)... all of which lead me to eventually do my PhD in math.\n\nAnd now I work in Quant Finance, where probability and stats are very important. \n\nPlease reach out to your friends and family and really be there for each other because you don't need to do this alone.

Also tough\u2014awkward introvert here. And personal life didn\u2019t offer much relief either.  Still, I kept going. I worked hard in my PS2, which became a job, and even repeated a course in my final semester to push my GPA over 7 so recruiters would notice me. That wasn\u2019t the end, though.

I was bad at academics (5-point CGPA), bad at English (everyone in Mime club would converse and joke around in English - I was the guy who was quiet for 1 year - not exaggerating), and I was fat (so no female attention). On top of this, I would think of my parents who would call every day expecting me to be having the best time of my life - all I would say is \"yes, it's great\". \nAll I had was perseverance. I fixed one thing at a time. In my 1-2, I found my comfort zone  to speak broken English with eventually giving me the confidence to build strong connections across everyone in the club by the 2nd year. In 2-1, after my parents forced me to quite mime due to CGPA, I decided to attend all classes - 2-1 GPA crossed 7 - hence, made the case to my parents to rejoin mime because friends = sanity. Finally, bombed all the limited interviews I was eligible for and had to join a mass hirer. Applied externally, got rejected everywhere. Finally landed my dream job - now 10 years have passed and I'm still here. And guess what, no one asks about my CGPA.\nGuys - life is not linear - not for you, not for the guy next to you. Everyone will go through deep trenches in life. All you need to do is persevere, somehow. If things feel overwhelming, talk to people and don't try to figure everything out at once.

You shall eventually figure the way out.\n4. Prefer IPC(Pilani) over library and room for exam preparation. the constant distraction in the Library and room will not let you concentrate. 2 hours of IPC Study = 15 hours of Library/30 hours of Room Study! I would say, IPC is the most underrated space in Pilani. I missed this place for 3 online semesters. \n5. Dream big and dont care about grades. Attempt the exam with your best efforts and leave the rest. You shall be remembered as BITSian, not as a 5 pointer.\n6. Explore as many as courses as you wish to. Many dull courses in a particular semester can be counterbalanced with a single interesting course. Entrepreneurship courses shall give you a real thrill, trust me! You will forget all monotony of life in the classroom.\n7. Keep Minor degree as a backup option. Investment of 20k (in our times) can give you an edge in off-campus (or on-campus) placements.\n8. Maintain good relationship with your professors (from your own and other Departments), so that you can contact them in the future whenever you need them.\n9. Being an introvert is fine.

Loved the content but never got good grades. Lots of C-s few Ds and one E as well. CG dropped significantly. Held 2 PORs and did significant work there. Started smoking lots of weed and experimented with other drugs as well. \n\nSomehow managed to survive 4-1.

Became suicidal and depressed. Started clinical counselling, medications and the usual stuff. But slowly realized gaps in it. Started questioning and deep diving into psychology and also explored spirituality and religions. Healed myself over the year drop, and practice schools and some initial years of jobs.

After taking a break for 6 months and doing some online courses from Udemy, I broke into data analytics. I am currently working to transition into data/ML engineering.

I got an NC in MuE, my cg was 3.73 that sem. I ended up repeating the course, and did ADVD with my juniors, AE in summer term.

Probably scored the lowest scores on our placement preparation mock tests. Failed so spectacularly that I might have set a record low (negative 15 marks out of 100 something). Trusting faculty members paid dividends. Seniors helped out. Inspired me to do something with my 2 theses, and that was all I needed. Confide in friends, seniors and family.
