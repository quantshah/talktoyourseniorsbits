Stress and mental health challenges are rising among BITS Pilani, Goa students 
— something many of us have experienced firsthand. We've all had tough times at 
BITS: academic pressure, uncertainty about the future, feeling overwhelmed. But 
one thing that always helped was talking to seniors — hearing their stories, 
knowing they made it through, and that life does get better. This initiative is 
a small step to offer that support to anyone who needs it. If you're struggling,
please know you're not alone. BITSians from different batches — seniors and 
alumni — are here to listen, share, and help you see that there's a way forward.

Whatever you’re facing, you can get through it. You’ve already achieved so much
by being at BITS — don’t let temporary struggles make you doubt your worth. 
We’ve been there too: low grades, failed courses, stress about placements or life
after college. And yet, life moves on — and many of us have gone on to build 
happy, meaningful lives.

This app connects you with alumni who care. Use it to talk to someone who's been
where you are.

Life is worth living. Just reach out.

# Data

Everything is open and public which makes it all the more powerful. The data is
from the Google Form where seniors can sign up and share their contact and
stories:

FORM: https://forms.gle/7zrNwL6mxYjmYfBeA

The app randomly selects three people from the signed up form for you and allows
you to email / message them with your own email to reach out.
